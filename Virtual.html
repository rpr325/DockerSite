      <h2>What is Virtualization</h2>
      <p>The text-book definition of virtualization is the conversion of computer-generated simulation of reality. The concept of virtualization is a broad aspect that has multiple different variations. This is mainly conceptualized as  hardware virtualization as well as process virtualization. Virtualization is the process of running a virtual instance of a computer system in a layer abstracted from the actual hardware. Most commonly, it refers to running multiple operating systems on a computer system simultaneously. To the applications running on top of the virtualized machine, it can appear as if they are on their own dedicated machine, where the operating system, libraries, and other programs are unique to the guest virtualized system and unconnected to the host operating system which sits below it. For many different reasons virtualization is useful.  To desktop users, the most common use is to be able to run applications meant for a different operating system without having to switch computers or reboot into a different system. For administrators of servers, virtualization also offers the ability to run different operating systems, but perhaps, more importantly, it offers a way to segment a large system into many smaller parts, allowing the server to be used more efficiently by a number of different users or applications with different needs. It also allows for isolation, keeping programs running inside of a virtual machine safe from the processes taking place in another virtual machine on the same host.
	A hyper visor is a program designed for creating and running virtual machines. These programs are split into two classes: type one (bare metal) hypervisors that run guest virtual machines directly on a systems hardware, which ultimately acts as an operating system. Type two (hosted) hypervisors behave on in the likeness of more traditional applications. These applications can normally start and stop. T
	The topic of hypervisors directly relates to the topics of virtual machines. Virtual machines are known as â€˜emulated equvilant of a computer system running on top of another. Thes machine can have access to a plethora of resources: computing power, CPU and memory, virtual disk devices for storage network interface, video cards, USB devices, and virtual machine shared device hardware. When a virtual machine is stored on a disk it is refeered to as a disk image. The disk image can contain files for virtula machjine booting as well as specific storage needs.</p>
